<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#Goals-of-this-Project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals of this Workshop</h3>

<p>This half-day workshop is intended for educational researchers or teachers who are interested in analyzing big data of learnersâ€™ online activities on social networking sites. </p>
<p>An increasing number of students have expressed their preference of using social networking sites, like Twitter or Facebook, for learning communication rather than using institutional learning management systems (Bosch, 2009; McCarthy, 2010). Some pioneering teachers and researchers have already chose to put part of their classroom learning and teaching activities on these sites or organize other online learning activities (Bosch, 2009; Williams & Chinn, 2009; Brady, Holcomb, & Smith, 2010; McLoughlin & Lee, 2010). Data can easily accumulate online to a gigantic amount, which brings new challenge to data collection and following analysis. This workshop aims at teaching practical skills on how to collect and analyze big data of online learning activities.</p>
<p>By the end of this workshop participants will be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>identify research questions that can be explored through data mining</li>
  <li>extract big data from social networking sites, like Facebook and Twitter</li>
  <li>identify ways to answer relevant research questions using big data analysis techniques</li>
</ol>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#Use-R" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use R</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a></strong> will be used as the main tool during this workshop. We will give a brief introduction on how to use R in the workshop.</p>
<p>If your laptop is running Windows, you are suggested to download <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> (You still need to download R first).</p>


<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#Talk-to-Twitter" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Talk to Twitter</h3>

<p>We will cover how to use <a href="http://oauth.net/" target="_blank">OAuth API</a> to make your script able to talk to Twitter. If you don't have a Twitter account, it is a good idea to register one before the workshop</p>.

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#Data-Cleaning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Cleaning</h3>

<p>We will cover some very fundamental rules and techniques on data cleaning. After this workshop, you will never go back to manual copy-and-paste any more.</p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#Sentiment-Analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sentiment Analysis</h3>

<p>How do people think about certain topics? How good are students' online reflection? How specific are students' goals? What is the interaction between students? What is the trend of this discussion?... There are many interesting research questions, and we will try to cover as many as possible.</p>
